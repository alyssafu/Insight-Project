# Insight-Project

TextFit is a webapp that gives users feedback on a comment that they want to submit. 

As more and more people use the internet to communicate with each other, harmful comments are on the rise in the form of trolling, flaming, and bullying. TextFit is a tool that can give people information about their comment using data and hopefully create a better experience for people on the internet.
